# Vault_Contributions
This repository is for those who want to submit vaults to the roguelike game Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup.
## Beginner's Guide
`Contribute_a_Vault_to_Crawl.pdf` is a comprehensive how-to for your first vault submission.  I tried to cover every question you might have but feel free to ask more!
## Image to Vault Glyphs
`vaultmap.py` and `Vault Builder Palette.gpl` are used to convert images at www.piskelapp.com into vault maps.  Sections 5 and 6 of the Beginner's Guide has instructions for this script if you are already familiar with making vaults.
